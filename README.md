# Reactjs Invoice App

This is the solution for [Frontend Mentor Invoice App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl). You can keep track of your personal invoices with this app. You can create a new invoice, save it as a draft or as pending, mark pending invoices as paid and edit any draft or pending invoices. Also you can filter the invoices by their draft/pending/paid status.

I used localstorage to ensure the invoice created persists after refreshing browser.
